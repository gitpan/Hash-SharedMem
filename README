NAME

Hash::SharedMem - efficient shared mutable hash

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a facility for efficiently sharing mutable data
between processes on one host.  Data is organised as a key/value store,
resembling a Perl hash.  The keys and values are restricted to octet
(Latin-1) strings.

The data is represented in files that are mapped into each process's
memory space, which for interprocess communication amounts to the
processes sharing memory.  Processes are never blocked waiting for each
other.  The use of files means that there is some persistence, with the
data continuing to exist when there are no processes with it mapped.
